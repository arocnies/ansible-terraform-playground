# ansible-terraform-playground
A simple template for working with Terraform and Ansible to provision containers on your local machine

## Quickstart
```shell
# Create the containers
$ terraform init
$ terraform apply

# Ping the hosts defined by the inventory file.
$ ansible all -i inventory.yml -m ping

# Run a playbook
$ ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml website_playbook.yml
```

## Inventory file
The inventory file is generated by Terraform. Feel free to make your own `hosts` file with the same content or in INI format:
```ini
container1  ansible_connection=docker

[webservers]
container2  ansible_connection=docker
```
